In this project, I utilized Microsoft Excel to clean, analyze, and visualize food delivery data from a company similar to DoorDash. I focused largely on the demographics of the users to spot trends and places to focus future marketing efforts.

For this project, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts' education data. I used Tableau Public to create the visualizations. <br><br>
The main focuses were:<br>
What high schools are struggling the most?<br>
How does class size affect graduation rate?<br>
What are the top schools for 4th grade math in the state?

This project focuses on projects in Haiti funded by the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA). Throughout the project, I use SQL to analyze the dataset and bring insight on how much money has been loaned to Haiti, how much money Haiti has repaid, and much more.
